              <h2>Passion</h2>
              <p>
                  When it came to computers I have always have had a natural nack for picking up different technologies and excitements for the different ways one can create things within tech. Though when it came to thinking of working in tech I had a very skewed concept of it, and ultimately thought why would I work in any form of computer science and technology. Only really smart people work in computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This ultimately ended with me pursuing a career in Psychology, but when I came to the realization after starting to work that any Masters degree I would possibly pursue was not what I really wanted. I searched why I chose Psych and what it offered me. I was interested in connecting to people, but having a quick turn around in the influence I have on the work that I would a part of. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I after a few months of searching opportunities, I ended up with coding, and joined a coding bootcamp in Washington DC metro area. There I found the love for creating application and sites from nothing. Finding myself being able to sit for hours creating a site on my own was miraculous because when it came to my Psych degree I had a hard time sitting down listening and working with the people in the nitty gritty, but when it came to figuring things out with my colleagues I was more energized about helping out.
